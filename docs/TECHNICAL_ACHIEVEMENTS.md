           bootstrap_servers=[KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS],
           group_id='dispatchai-gateway'
       )
       
       for message in consumer:
           asyncio.run(process_kafka_message(message))
   
   # Manual correction with proper schema alignment
   cur.execute("""
       INSERT INTO dispatchai.manual_corrections (
           enriched_issue_id, field_name, original_value, corrected_value
       ) VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s)
