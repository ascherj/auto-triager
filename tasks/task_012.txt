# Task ID: 12
# Title: Load Testing and Performance Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Conduct load testing to ensure the system can handle the required throughput of 1,000 issues per minute and optimize performance bottlenecks.
# Details:
1. Create load testing scripts using Locust or k6:
```python
# locustfile.py
from locust import HttpUser, task, between
import json

class WebhookUser(HttpUser):
    wait_time = between(0.1, 0.5)  # 2-10 requests per second
    
    @task
    def post_issue(self):
        payload = {
            "action": "opened",
            "issue": {
                "id": self.environment.runner.user_count + self.environment.runner.last_request_id,
                "number": 1234,
                "title": "Test issue title",
                "body": "This is a test issue body with some details about a bug.",
                "user": {"login": "testuser"},
                "created_at": "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z",
                "repository": {"full_name": "test/repo"}
            }
        }
        self.client.post(
            "/webhook/github",
            json=payload,
            headers={
                "X-GitHub-Event": "issues",
                "X-Hub-Signature-256": "sha256=test"
            }
        )
```
2. Configure test scenarios:
   - Steady load at target throughput
   - Burst traffic patterns
   - Sustained maximum load
3. Identify and optimize bottlenecks:
   - Database query optimization
   - Kafka producer/consumer tuning
   - FastAPI concurrency settings
   - WebSocket connection handling
4. Implement horizontal scaling for worker pool
5. Add caching for frequently accessed data
6. Optimize OpenAI API usage with batching where possible

# Test Strategy:
1. Run load tests in staging environment
2. Measure end-to-end latency under load
3. Monitor resource utilization (CPU, memory, network)
4. Identify bottlenecks using profiling tools
5. Verify system stability under sustained load
6. Test recovery from overload conditions
